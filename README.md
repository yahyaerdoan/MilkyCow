# Milky Cow RESTful API Project
## 
Completed this project by M&Y Yazılım Eğitim Akademi Danışmanlık and by Murat Yücedağ training.
- Excited to share my expertise in creating robust web applications using the latest technologies. 
- Honed my skills and delivered high-quality software solutions.
- Designed and implemented efficient communication between client and server using RESTful API and Minimal API. 
- By utilizing DTO and AutoMapper, streamlined data management and transformation, ensuring integrity and reducing boilerplate code.
- Implementing Dependency Injection has allowed me to create loosely coupled, testable, and maintainable code, enhancing modularity.
- With Generic Repository Design, promoted code reuse and adhered to SOLID principles by abstracting data access logic. 
- Through N-Tier Architecture, developed scalable and maintainable applications with clear separation of concerns. 
- Incorporating NToastNotify in my projects has enriched user interaction with real-time notifications. 
- Utilizing Areas and View Components in ASP.NET Core MVC has enabled me to organize large applications effectively, improving structure and maintainability.
- Implementing generic dynamic consumption patterns has empowered me to build highly flexible and reusable code components, making my applications more adaptable to changing requirements.
